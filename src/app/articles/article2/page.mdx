## Situation:
Blue Clover Devices needed to streamline microcontroller testing and the sales demo environment to reduce engineering resources in pre-sales and improve customer satisfaction in edge cases.

## Task:

My team had to collaborate with the software team to develop microcontroller test suites.
We acted as a technical partner to support pre/post sales processes and RFP responses.
My team was also tasked with improving the sales demo environments for hardware products and accelerate pre-sales engagements.
We worked with DevOps to automate deployments and improve overall software delivery pipelines.

## Action:

- We created microcontroller tests using YAML & Docker, reducing edge case requests by clients.
- We partnered with CTO to build and maintain the sales demo environment, optimizing the pre-sales cycle.
- We gathered requirements and developed test cases using YAML & Python, ensuring thorough testing across products & implemented CI/CD pipelines with DevOps, increasing deployment efficiency.
## Result:

- Reduced client requests by 50% for microcontroller tests through the test suite development.
- Decreased cash conversion cycle by 50% and reduced engineering involvement in pre-sales by 20%.
- Delivered 10 successful projects within time and budget, driving high customer satisfaction and generating repeat business.
